## Introduction

This project provides a comprehensive Sudoku solver, which can:
- Solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm.
- Represent Sudoku as a graph and solve it using a graph coloring algorithm.
- Compare the performance of different solving techniques using pure Python and NumPy.
- Visualize the solving process both statically and interactively.
- Analyze the performance of different solving methods.
